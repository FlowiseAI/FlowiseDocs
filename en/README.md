# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/FlowiseIntro (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Flowise is an open source generative AI development platform for building AI Agents and LLM workflows.

It offers a complete solution that includes:

* [x] Visual Builder
* [x] Tracing & Analytics
* [x] Evaluations
* [x] Human in the Loop
* [x] API, CLI, SDK, Embedded Chatbot
* [x] Teams & Workspaces

There are 3 main visual builders namely:

* Assistant
* Chatflow
* Agentflow

## Assistant

Assistant is the most begineer-friendly way of creating an AI Agent. Users can create chat assistant that is able to follow instructions, use tools when neccessary, and retrieve knowledge base from uploaded files ([RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)) to respond to user queries.

## Chatflow

Chatflow is designed to build single-agent systems, chatbots and simple LLM flows. It is more flexible than Assistant. Users can use advance techniques like Graph RAG, Reranker, Retriever, etc.

## Agentflow

Agentflow is the superset of Chatflow & Assistant. It can be used to create chat assistant, single-agent system, multi-agent systems, and complex workflow orchestration. Learn more [Agentflow V2](using-flowise/agentflowv2.md)
