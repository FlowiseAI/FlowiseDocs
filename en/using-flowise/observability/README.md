## API

Once the analytic has been turned ON from the UI, you can override or provide additional configuration in the body of the [Prediction API](api.md#prediction-api):

```json
{
  "question": "hi there",
  "overrideConfig": {
    "analytics": {
      "langFuse": {
        // langSmith, langFuse, lunary, langWatch
        "userId": "user1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
