# Embeddings

Embeddings can be used to create a numerical representation of textual data. This numerical representation is useful because it can be used to find similar documents.

Below are some of the embedding models available to use in Flowise:

* [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](azure-openai-embeddings.md)
* [LocalAI Embeddings](localai-embeddings.md)
