* FLOWISE\_PASSWORD

6. There are list of env variables you can configure. Refer to [environment-variables.md](../environment-variables.md "mention")

That's it! You now have a deployed Flowise on Railway [ðŸŽ‰](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper/)[ðŸŽ‰](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper/)

## Persistent Volume

The default filesystem for services running on Railway is ephemeral. Flowise data isnâ€™t persisted across deploys and restarts. To solve this issue, we can use [Railway Volume](https://docs.railway.app/reference/volumes).

To ease the steps, we have a Railway template with volume mounted: [https://railway.app/template/nEGbjR](https://railway.app/template/nEGbjR)

Just click Deploy and fill in the Env Variables like below:

* DATABASE\_PATH - `/opt/railway/.flowise`
* APIKEY\_PATH - `/opt/railway/.flowise`
* LOG\_PATH - `/opt/railway/.flowise/logs`
* SECRETKEY\_PATH - `/opt/railway/.flowise`
* BLOB\_STORAGE\_PATH - `/opt/railway/.flowise/storage`

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="420"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now try creating a flow and save it in Flowise. Then try restarting service or redeploy, you should still be able to see the flow you have saved previously.
