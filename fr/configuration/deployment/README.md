# Deployment

***

Flowise is designed with a platform-agnostic architecture, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of deployment environments to suit your infrastructure needs.

## Local Machine

To deploy Flowise locally, follow our [Get Started](../../getting-started/) guide.

## Modern Cloud Providers

Modern cloud platforms prioritize automation and focus on developer workflows, simplifying cloud management and ongoing maintenance.&#x20;

This reduces the technical expertise needed, but may limit the level of customization you have over the underlying infrastructure.
