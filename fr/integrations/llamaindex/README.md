# LlamaIndex

***

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. It has advanced retrieval techniques for designing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) apps.

Flowise complements LlamaIndex by offering a visual interface. Here, nodes are organized into distinct sections, making it easier to build workflows.

### LlamaIndex Sections:

* [Agents](agents/)
* [Chat Models](chat-models/)
* [Embeddings](embeddings/)
* [Engine](engine/)
* [Response Synthesizer](response-synthesizer/)
* [Tools](tools/)
* [Vector Stores](vector-stores/)
