## Definitions

**A retrieval-based question-answering chain**, which integrates with a retrieval component and allows you to configure input parameters and perform question-answering tasks.\
**Retrieval-Based Chatbots:** Retrieval-based chatbots are chatbots that generate responses by selecting pre-defined responses from a database or a set of possible responses. They "retrieve" the most appropriate response based on the input from the user.\
**QA (Question Answering):** QA systems are designed to answer questions posed in natural language. They typically involve understanding the question and searching for or generating an appropriate answer.
