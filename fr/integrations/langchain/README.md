# LangChain

***

[**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It simplifies the process of creating generative AI application, connecting data sources, vectors, memories with LLMs.

Flowise complements LangChain by offering a visual interface. Here, nodes are organized into distinct sections, making it easier to build workflows.

### LangChain Sections:

* [Agents](agents/)
* [Cache](cache/)
* [Chains](chains/)
* [Chat Models](chat-models/)
* [Document Loaders](document-loaders/)
* [Embeddings](embeddings/)
* [LLMs](llms/)
* [Memory](memory/)
* [Moderation](moderation/)
* [Output Parsers](output-parsers/)
* [Prompts](prompts/)
* [Record Managers](record-managers.md)
* [Retrievers](retrievers/)
* [Text Splitters](text-splitters/)
* [Tools](tools/)
* [Vector Stores](vector-stores/)
