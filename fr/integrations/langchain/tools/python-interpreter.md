# Code Interpreter by E2B

[E2B](https://e2b.dev/) is an open-source runtime for executing AI-generated code in secure cloud sandboxes. For example, when user asks to generate a bar graph of the data, LLM will output python code needed to plot the graph. This generated code will be sent to E2B, and the output of the execution will contains images of the graph, codes, text and etc. These outputs are sent back to LLM for final processing before getting displayed on the chat.
