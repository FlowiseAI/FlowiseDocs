# Langfuse

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

With the native integration, you can use Flowise to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.

The integration supports all use cases of Flowise, including: interactively in the UI, API, and embeds.

You can optionally add `release` to tag the current version of the flow. You usually don't need to change the other options.
