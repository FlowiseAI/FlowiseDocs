# Agentflows

## Introducing Agentic Systems in Flowise

Flowise's Agentflows section provides a platform for building agent-based systems that can interact with external tools and data sources.

Currently, Flowise offers two approaches for designing these systems: [**Multi-Agents**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and [**Sequential Agents**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. These approaches provide different levels of control and complexity, allowing you to choose the best fit for your needs.

{% hint style="success" %}
This documentation will explore both the Sequential Agent and Multi-Agent approaches, explaining their features and how they can be used to build different types of conversational workflows.
{% endhint %}

[^1]: **Multi-Agents**, built on top of the Sequential Agent architecture, simplify the process of building and managing teams of agents by pre-configuring core elements and providing a higher-level abstraction.

[^2]: **Sequential Agents** provide developers with direct access to the underlying workflow structure, enabling granular control over every step of the conversation flow and offering maximum flexibility for building highly customized conversational applications.
